# React SPA with Micro Frontends

This is a sample React application built with Vite, Zustand, TanStack Router, and TypeScript, designed for a lecture on Micro Frontends. The application demonstrates the integration of multiple Micro Frontends into a single application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6 or later)

### Setting up the Project

1. **Install Node.js and npm (or yarn)**

   If you haven't already, install Node.js and npm (or yarn) on your machine. You can download them from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Create a new React project with TypeScript using Vite**

   ```
   npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**

   ```
   npm install @tanstack/react-router zustand
   ```

### Configuring TanStack Router

1. Create a new file, e.g., `router.tsx`, where you'll set up your routes.
2. Import the necessary components from `@tanstack/react-router`.
3. Define your routes and create a `<Router>` component to wrap your application.

### Setting up Zustand

1. Create a new file, e.g., `store.ts`, where you'll define your Zustand store.
2. Import the `create` function from `zustand`.
3. Define your store's state and actions using TypeScript interfaces or types.

### Building the Application Structure

1. Create components for your different pages or features using TypeScript files (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`).
2. Use the `<Link>` component from TanStack Router to navigate between routes.
3. Inject the Zustand store into your components using the `useStore` hook, ensuring proper type safety.

## Next Steps

After following the steps above, you can proceed to implement the Micro Frontends integration and prepare the lecture content. Refer to the official documentation and resources for React, Vite, Zustand, TanStack Router, TypeScript, and Micro Frontends for more detailed guidance.
